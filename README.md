## Getting Started

### Manage Environment

Execute the shell script `env.sh` to build the project environment and install the require dependencies.

```shell script
# make script executable
chmod +x ./env.sh
./env.sh
```

The shell script will build a `data` directory and create a conda environment `burgwyn_data601_final`
